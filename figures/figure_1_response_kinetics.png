Title: "CD8+ T-cell Activation Kinetics Post-TIRA Administration"
X-axis: Days Post-Injection (0, 1, 3, 7, 14)
Y-axis: % CD69+ CD8+ T-cells in dLN
Lines:
  - PBS (flat, ~2-3%)
  - Empty Vector (slight bump to ~5% at day 3)
  - TIRA Vector (sharp peak to ~65% at day 3, sustained ~25% at day 14)
Caption: TIRA induces rapid, durable activation of tumor-draining lymph node CD8+ T-cells.
