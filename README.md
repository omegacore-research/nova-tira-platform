# NOVA-TIRA Platform: Targeted Immune Recognition Amplification (Proof of Concept)

**Repository Status:** Research Validation | Concept Stage  
**Last Updated:** 2/10/2026 

**Notice:** This repository contains non-clinical research data and protocols published for scientific discourse and independent verification. This is not a therapeutic product. See [DISCLAIMER.md](./DISCLAIMER.md) before use.
## Overview

This repository documents a novel immune system priming concept, referred to as Targeted Immune Recognition Amplification (TIRA). The core hypothesis is that engineered molecular templates can guide antigen-presenting cells to recognize a broader spectrum of tumor-associated signatures, thereby amplifying endogenous anti-cancer immunity.

**Important:** This is a research framework published for scientific discourse. This is **not** a therapy, treatment, or cure. This work is not intended for human use. See [DISCLAIMER.md](./DISCLAIMER.md).

## What's Here

- `CONCEPT.md` – Theoretical framework and mechanism overview.
- `VERIFICATION.md` – Step-by-step protocol to replicate the observed immune response shift *in vitro* and *in vivo* (murine models).
- `protocols/` – Detailed methods for verification and safety screening.
- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets from pilot experiments.
- `figures/` – Key results visualizing immune marker shifts and tumor growth modulation.

## Replication

If you're looking to verify the immune priming effect, start with `VERIFICATION.md` and the protocols in `/protocols`. The data in `/data` corresponds to the figures.
